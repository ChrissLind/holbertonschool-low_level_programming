# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
In this project I work with variables of type `char` `int` `unsigned int` and how to assign values to them, `if` and `else` statements, implimenting `while` and `for` loops. 

Also understanding arithmetic logical and realational operators, boolean (true and false) operators, implimenting comments into my code is helpful/important, the ASCII character set and various printf format specifiers.
