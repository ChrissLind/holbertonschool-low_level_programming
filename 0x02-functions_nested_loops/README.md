# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

In this project I work with nested loops. What are functions and the difference between a declaration and definition of a function. What is a prototype. The scope of variables in the C programming language. Header files and how to use them with `#include`


## Tasks ðŸ“œ

  - [0-putchar.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c) A function that prints the string "\_putchar", followed by a newline.

- **1.  I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
