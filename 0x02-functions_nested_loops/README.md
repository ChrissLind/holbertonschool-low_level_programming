# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops :repeat:

In this project I work with nested loops. What are functions and the difference between a declaration and definition of a function. What is a prototype. The scope of variables in the C programming language. Header files and how to use them with `#include`


## Tasks ðŸ“œ

- **0.\_putchar**
  - [0-putchar.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c) A function that prints the string "\_putchar", followed by a newline.


- **1.  I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  - [1-alphabet.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/1-alphabet.c) A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a newline.

  - [6-abs.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/6-abs.c) A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.


- **7.There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important**
  - [7-print_last_didgit.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/7-print_last_digit.c) A function that prints the last digit of a number.


- **8.I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life**
  - [8-24_hours.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/8-24_hours.c) A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.


- **9.Learn your times table**
  - [9-times_table.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/9-times_table.c) A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.


- **10.a + b**
  - [10-add.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/10-add.c) A function that adds two integers and returns the result.


- **11.98 Battery Street, the OG**
  - [11-print_to_98.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/11-print_to_98.c) A function that prints all natural number form `n` to `98`, followed by a newline.


- **12.The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself**
  - [100-times_table.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/100-times_table.c) A function that prints the `n` times table, starting at 0.


- **13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women**
  - [101-natural.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/101-natural.c) A function that lists all the natural number below `10` that ar multiples of `3` or `5`.


- **14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A**
  - [102-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/102-fibonacci.c) A program that prints the first 50 Fionacci number, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
