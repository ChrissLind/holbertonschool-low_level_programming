# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while :twisted_rightwards_arrows: :repeat:
In this project I work with variables of type `char` `int` `unsigned int` and how to assign values to them, `if` and `else` statements, implimenting `while` and `for` loops. 

Also understanding arithmetic logical and realational operators, boolean (true and false) operators, implimenting comments into my code is helpful/important, the ASCII character set and various printf format specifiers.

## Tasks ðŸ“œ

- **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  - [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative.

- **1. The last digit**
  - [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line.

- **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  - [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

- **3. alphABET**

- **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  - [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

- **5. Numbers**
  - [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

- **6. Numberz**
  - [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice without any variables of type `char`.

- **7. Smile in the mirror**
  - [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

- **8. Hexadecimal**
  - [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times.

- **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  - [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly four times without and variables of type `char`.

- **10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  - [10-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any variables of type `char`.

- **11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do..**
  - [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c) C program that prints all possible different combinations of 3 digits using only the `putchar` function exactly six times without any variables of type `char`.

- **12. Software is eating the World**
  - [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/ChrissLind/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c) C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using only the `putchar` function exactly 8 times without any variables of type `char`.
